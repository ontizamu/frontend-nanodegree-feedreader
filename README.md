# Project 6 Feed Reader Testing


This project was done as part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree, and consists in writing 7 tests against an application that reads RSS feeds. The tests are:

1. Ensure that the allFeeds variable has been defined and that is not empty.

2. Loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined
   and that the URL is not empty. 

3. Loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined
   and that the name is not empty.

4. Ensure the menu element is hidden by default.

5. Ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.

6. Ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.

7. Ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes. 

## How to run the application

Open index.html. The application will open and in the bottom part of the screen it could be seen a Jasmine message.The message should be say "7 specs, 0 failures" and it lists all the specs.
